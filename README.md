# Shutter Image Gallery
Shutter is an interactive web application for uploading, storing, and managing images. It is built using Laravel and is based upon the Spatie Media Library package. Images can be viewed both individually and as a group, whereby individual images are loaded into a modal, while grouped images are displayed in a grid. In addition, images can also be added to albums, favourited, and much more.
